# brewfile

This is a list of things I like to have on my development Mac.

## How to use this

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
1. In your home directory create a file called `Brewfile`, and copy & paste content of the attached `Brewfile`
1. `brew tap Homebrew/bundle`

## Some helpful things

- `brew install git` - installs software
- `brew cask install google-chrome` - installs Mac applications
- `brew bundle` - runs the brewfile
